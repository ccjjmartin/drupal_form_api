# Madlib

The madlib module uses the Drupal Form API to display text about Giraffes in a fun way.

It is currently working with the minimum desired functionality.  On both JS enabled clients and JS disabled clients.

POSSIBLE ADDITIONS:

* Errors output to screen on each element during ajax callback
* Add AJAX to the submit button
* Recognition (intelligence) of JS enabled clients versus JS disabled clients (possible form value)

REFACTOR:

* Separate user input ajax from submit ajax
* Separate validation into two categories the entire form versus a single element
